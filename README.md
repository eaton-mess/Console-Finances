# Console-Finances

## Description 

This repository ("Console-Finances") aims to use the existing numbers provided within the JavaScript file and calciulate various totals and equations to result in the desired outcome. The JavaScript that follows should be functional and provide not only accurate data, but in a way that makes it easy to consume and read. It utilises numerous variables and methods such as the 'for loop' to result in a clear, definitive answer in response to the needs of this challenge.
